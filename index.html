		<h1>The Node Beginner Book</h1>


			<h2>Preface</h2>

				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>
					The aim of this document is to get you started with developing
					applications for node.js, teaching you everything you need to
					know about "advanced" JavaScript along the way. It goes way
					beyond your typical "hello world" tutorial.
				</p>

				<h3>Intended audience</h3>
				<p>
					This document will probably fit best for readers that have a
					background similar to my own: experienced with at least one
					object-oriented language like Ruby, Python PHP or Java, only little
					experience with JavaScript, and completely new to node.js.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aiming at developers that already have experience with other
					programming languages means that this document won't cover
					really basic stuff like data types, variables, control structures
					and the likes. You already need to know about these to understand
					this document.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, because functions and objects in JavaScript are different
					from their counterparts in most other languages, these will be
					explained in more detail.
				</p>

				<h3>Structure of this document</h3>
				<p>
					Upon finishing this document, you will have created a complete web
					application which allows the users of this application to view web
					pages and upload files.
					<br />
					Which, of course, is not exactly
					world-changing, but we will go some extra miles and not only create
					the code that is "just enough" to make these use cases possible,
					but create a simple, yet complete framework to cleanly separate the
					different aspects of our application. You will see what I mean in a
					minute.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will start with looking at how JavaScript development in node.js
					is different from JavaScript development in a browser.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, we will stay with the good old tradition of writing a "Hello
					World" application, which is a most basic node.js application that
					"does" something.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then, we will discuss what kind of "real" application we want to
					build, dissect the different parts which need to be implemented to
					assemble this application, and start working on each of these parts
					step-by-step.
				</p>
				<p>
					As promised, along the way we will learn about some of the more
					advanced concepts of JavaScript, how to make use of them, and
					looking at why it makes sense to use these concepts instead of
					those we know from other programming languages.
				</p>


			<h2>JavaScript and node.js</h2>

				<h3>JavaScript and You</h3>
				<p>
					Before we talk about all the technical stuff, let's take a
					moment and talk about you and your relationship with
					JavaScript. This chapter is here to allow you to estimate
					if reading this document any further makes sense for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are like me, you started with HTML "development"
					long ago, by writing HTML documents. You came along this
					funny thing called JavaScript, but you only used it in a
					very basic way, adding interactivity to your web pages
					every now and then.
				</p>
				<p>
					What you really wanted was "the real thing", you wanted to
					know how to build complex web sites - you learned a
					programming language like PHP, Ruby, Java, and started
					writing "backend" code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, you kept an eye on JavaScript, you saw that
					with the introduction of jQuery, Prototype and the likes,
					things got more advanced in JavaScript land, and that this
					language really was about more than <em>window.open()</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this was all still frontend stuff, and although it
					was nice to have jQuery at your disposal whenever you felt
					like spicing up a web page, at the end of the day you were,
					at best, a JavaScript <em>user</em>, but not a JavaScript
					<em>developer</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					And then came node.js. JavaScript on the server, how cool
					is that?
				</p>
				<p>
					You decided that it's about time to check out the old, new
					JavaScript. But wait, writing node.js applications is the
					one thing; understanding why they need to be written the
					way they are written means - understanding JavaScript.
					And this time for real.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is the problem: Because JavaScript really lives two,
					maybe even three lives (the funny little DHMTL helper from
					the mid-90's, the more serious frontend stuff like jQuery
					and the likes, and now server-side), it's not that easy to
					find information that helps you to learn JavaScript the
					"right" way, in order to write node.js applications in a
					fashion that makes you feel you are not just using
					JavaScript, you are actually developing it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because that's the catch, you already are an experienced
					developer, you don't want to learn a new technique by just
					hacking around and mis-using it, you want to be sure that
					you are approaching it from the right angle.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is, of course, excellent documentation out there.
					But documentation alone	sometimes isn't enough. What is
					needed is guidance.
				</p>
				<p>
					My goal is to provide a guide for you.
				</p>

				<h3>A word of warning</h3>
				<p>
					There are some really excellent JavaScript people out
					there. I'm not one of them.
					<br />
					I'm really the guy I talked about in the previous
					paragraph. I know a thing or two about developing backend
					web applications, but I'm still new to "real" JavaScript
					and	still new to node.js. I learned some of the more
					advanced aspects of	JavaScript just recently.
					I'm not experienced.
				</p>
				<p>
					Which is why this is no "from novice to expert" book. It's
					more like "from novice to expert novice".
				</p>
				<p>
					If I don't fail, then this here will be the kind of
					document I wish I had when starting with node.js.
				</p>

				<h3>Server-side JavaScript</h3>
				<p>
					The first incarnations of JavaScript lived in browsers.
					But this is just the context. It defines what you can
					do with the language, but it doesn't say much about what
					the language itself can do. JavaScript is a "complete"
					language, you can use it in many contexts and achieve
					everything with it you can achieve with any other
					"complete" language.
				</p>
				<p>
					node.js really is just another context: it allows to run
					JavaScript code in the backend, outside a browser.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to execute the JavaScript you intend to run in the
					backend, it needs to be interpreted and, well, executed.
					This is what node.js does. Plus, it ships with a lot of
					useful modules, so you don't have to write everything
					from scratch, like for example something that outputs a
					string on the console.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, node.js is really two things: a runtime
					environment and a library.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to make use of them, you need to install node.
					Instead of repeating the process here, I ask you to visit
					<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation"
					   title="Building and Installing Node.js">the official
					installation instructions</a>. Please come back once you
					are up and running.
				</p>

				<h3>"Hello Server"</h3>
				<p>
					Ok, let's just jump in the cold water and write our first
					node application: "Hello Server"
				</p>
				<p>
					Open your favorite editor and create a file called
					<em>helloserver.js</em>. We want it to write "Hello Server"
					to STDOUT, and here is the code needed to do that:
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre>var sys = require("sys");

sys.puts("Hello Server");
</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
					Save the file, and execute it through node.js:
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre>node helloworld.js</pre>
				</p>
				<p>
					This should output <em>Hello World</em> on your terminal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ok, this stuff is boring, right? Let's write some real
					stuff.
				</p>


			<h2>A full blown web application with node</h2>

				<h3>The use cases</h3>
				<p>
					Let's keep it simple, but realistic:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The user should be able to use our application with
							a web browser
						</li>
						<li>
							The user should see a welcome page when
							requesting http://<em>domain</em>/start
						</li>
						<li>
							When requesting http://<em>domain</em>/upload, the
							user should be able to upload an image file	from
							his computer, which is then displayed in his
							browser.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Fair enough. Now, you could achieve this goal by googling
					and hacking together <em>something</em>. But that's not
					what we want to do here.
					<br />
					Furthermore, we don't want to write only the most basic
					code to achieve the goal, how elegant and correct this code
					might be. We will intentionally add more abstraction than
					necessary in order to get a feeling for building more
					complex node applications.
				</p>

				<h3>The application stack</h3>
				<p>
					Let's dissect our application. Which parts need to be
					implemented in order to fulfill the use cases?

					<ul>
						<li>
							We want to serve web pages, therefore we need an
							<strong>HTTP server</strong>
						</li>
						<li>
							Our server will need to answer differently to
							requests, depending on which URL the request was
							asking for, thus we need some kind of
							<strong>router</strong> in order to map requests
							to request handlers
						</li>
						<li>
							To fullfill the requests that arrived at the server
							and have been routed using the router, we need
							actual <strong>request handlers</strong>
						</li>
						<li>
							The router probably should also treat any incoming
							POST data and give it to the request handlers in
							a convenient form, thus we need a <strong>request
							data handler</strong>.
						</li>
						<li>
							We not only want to handle requests for URLs, we
							also want to display content when these URLs are
							requested, which means we need some kind of
							<strong>view logic</strong> the request handlers
							can use in order to send content to the user's
							browser.
						</li>
						<li>
							Last but not least, the user will be able to upload
							images, so we are going to need an
							<strong>upload handler</strong> to take care of the
							details.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's think a moment about how we would build this stack
					with PHP. It's not exactly a secret that the typical setup
					would be an Apache HTTP server with mod_php5 installed.
					<br/>
					Which in turn means, that the whole "we need to be able to
					serve web pages and receive HTTP requests" stuff doesn't
					happen within PHP itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, with node, things are a bit different. Because with
					node, you not implement your application, you also
					implement the whole HTTP server. In fact, your web
					application	and its web server are basically the same.
				</p>
				<p>
					This might sound like a lot of work, but we will see in a
					moment that with node, it's not.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's just start at the beginning and implement the first
					part of our stack, the HTTP server.
				</p>
