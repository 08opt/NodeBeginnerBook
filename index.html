		<h1>The Node Beginner Book</h1>


			<h2>Preface</h2>

				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>
					The aim of this document is to get you started with developing
					applications for node.js, teaching you everything you need to
					know about "advanced" JavaScript along the way.
				</p>

				<h3>Intended audience</h3>
				<p>
					This document will probably fit best for readers that have a
					background similar to my own: experienced with at least one
					object-oriented language like Ruby, Python PHP or Java, only little
					experience with JavaScript, and completely new to node.js.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aiming at developers that already have experience with other
					programming languages means that this document won't cover
					really basic stuff like data types, variables, control structures
					and the likes. You already need to know about these to understand
					this document.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, because functions and objects in JavaScript are different
					from their counterparts in most other languages, these will be
					explained in more detail.
				</p>

				<h3>Structure of this document</h3>
				<p>
					Upon finishing this document, you will have created a complete web
					application which allows the users of this application to view web
					pages and upload files.
					<br />
					Which, of course, is not exactly
					world-changing, but we will go some extra miles and not only create
					the code that is "just enough" to make these use cases possible,
					but create a simple, yet complete framework to cleanly separate the
					different aspects of our application. You will see what I mean in a
					minute.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will start with looking at how JavaScript development in node.js
					is different from JavaScript development in a browser.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, we will stay with the good old tradition of writing a "Hello
					World" application, which is a most basic node.js application that
					"does" something.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then, we will discuss what kind of "real" application we want to
					build, dissect the different parts which need to be implemented to
					assemble this application, and start working on each of these parts
					step-by-step.
				</p>
				<p>
					As promised, along the way we will learn about some of the more
					advanced concepts of JavaScript, how to make use of them, and
					looking at why it makes sense to use these concepts instead of
					those we know from other programming languages.
				</p>


			<h2>JavaScript and node.js</h2>

				<h3>JavaScript and You</h3>
				<p>
					Before we talk about all the technical stuff, let's take a
					moment and talk about you and your relationship with
					JavaScript. This chapter is here to allow you to estimate
					if reading this document any further makes sense for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are like me, you started with HTML "development"
					long ago, by writing HTML documents. You came along this
					funny thing called JavaScript, but you only used it in a
					very basic way, adding interactivity to your web pages
					every now and then.
				</p>
				<p>
					What you really wanted was "the real thing", you wanted to
					know how to build complex web sites - you learned a
					programming language like PHP, Ruby, Java, and started
					writing "backend" code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, you kept an eye on JavaScript, you saw that
					with the introduction of jQuery, Prototype and the likes,
					things got more advanced in JavaScript land, and that this
					language really was about more than <em>window.open()</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this was all still frontend stuff, and although it
					was nice to have jQuery at your disposal whenever you felt
					like spicing up a web page, at the end of the day you were,
					at best, a JavaScript <em>user</em>, but not a JavaScript
					<em>developer</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					And then came node.js. JavaScript on the server, how cool
					is that?
				</p>
				<p>
					You decided that it's about time to check out the old, new
					JavaScript. But wait, writing node.js applications is the
					one thing; understanding why they need to be written the
					way they are written means - understanding JavaScript.
					And this time for real.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is the problem: Because JavaScript really lives two,
					maybe even three lives (the funny little DHMTL helper from
					the mid-90's, the more serious frontend stuff like jQuery
					and the likes, and now server-side), it's not that easy to
					find information that helps you to learn JavaScript the
					"right" way, in order to write node.js applications in a
					fashion that makes you feel you are not just using
					JavaScript, you are actually developing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because that's the catch, you already are an experienced
					developer, you don't want to learn a new technique by just
					hacking around and mis-using it, you want to be sure that
					you are approaching it from the right angle.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is, of course, excellent documentation out there.
					But documentation alone	sometimes isn't enough. What is
					needed is guidance.
				</p>
				<p>
					My goal is to provide a guide for you.
				</p>

				<h3>A word of warning</h3>
				<p>
					There are some really excellent JavaScript people out
					there. I'm not one of them.
					<br />
					I'm really the guy I talked about in the previous
					paragraph. I know a thing or two about developing backend
					web applications, but I'm still new to "real" JavaScript
					and	still new to node.js. I learned some of the more
					advanced aspects of	JavaScript just recently.
					I'm not experienced.
				</p>
				<p>
					Which is why this is no "from novice to expert" book. It's
					more like "from novice to expert novice".
				</p>
				<p>
					If I don't fail, then this here will be the kind of
					document I wish I had when starting with node.js.
